After the SaveRequestAcceptedIntegrationEvent event is published, 
the event can be captured by all currently active listeners. 
This means that the recording can be made by another server. 
This problem can be overcome by making a broker type topic.

Another weakness is that direct registration is not possible. 
Orders can only be placed for the registration process. 
This may also extend the recording time. 
This time will increase even more in cases where rabbit tails are dense.
